Welcome! Iâ€™m **Eugene Toh**, an undergraduate student at **Singapore Management University**. I created this course website to document my learning journey in **IS415: Geospatial Analytics and Applications**, taught by Professor Kam Tin Seong. Join me as I explore the realms of big data, geospatial analysis, and urban planning.
